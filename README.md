# MKDocs for Matlab POC

This repository is a proof of concept. I attempted to create an automatic documentation for matlab source code. 

In the process, I have found that [MatConvNet](https://github.com/vlfeat/matconvnet) had already done what I envisioned for this project. Therefore, I just made a toy project to try it out.

More information about this repo on [my blog post](https://gtpedrosa.github.io/blog/generating-documentation-of-matlab-scripts-automatically-with-mkdocs/).
