# MKDocs for Matlab POC

This repository is a Proof of Concept (POC). I attempted to create an automatic documentation workflow for Matlab source code focused on imperative language use. 

In the process, I have found that [MatConvNet](https://github.com/vlfeat/matconvnet) had already done what I envisioned for this project. In fact, they went beyond. Therefore, I just made a toy project to try it out.
